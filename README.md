# Fan-Balancing
This code snippet on Matlab balances a 3 bladed fan. 
Given that each blade has +/- 10% assembly error and +/- 5% manufacturing error, the algorithm finds the worst case (i.e. which values of the errors for each blade corresponding to the worst case) and calculates at which angle and the value of the mass to be added in order to balance the system at 2-in radius.
